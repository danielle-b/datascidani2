I’ve decided to face my fear and enter the world of data science. I’ve always admired data visualizations and have long been interested in how data is used to make business decisions. However, the idea of programming combined with statistics has always intimidated me a bit. My goal is to become a data analyst (and eventually a data scientist) by strengthening my programming and statistical skills. I’ll share what I’m learning; I’ll discuss projects, books/articles I’ve read and really any thoughts I have pertaining to data science.
