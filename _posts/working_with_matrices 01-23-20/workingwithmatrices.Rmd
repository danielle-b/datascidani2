A matrix is a collection of elements of the same data type, with the data being arranged into rows and columns. Because it consists of both rows and columns, matrices are considered two-dimensional as opposed to vectors, which are considered one-dimensional. 

DataQuest analyzes university rankings for this lesson. However, for this post, I decided that I would analyze six of the highest-grossing films of all time. The data that I’ll be working with in this post comes from [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW). Please note that for the last two columns, Budget in Millions and Domestic Opening in Millions, I rounded the numbers so the values in these columns are not exact.

## Combining Vectors into Matrices

To create a matrix using the data above, DataQuest taught me that I must first create vectors.

```{r echo=TRUE}
endgame <-c(1, 2019, 181, 356, 357)
avatar <-c(2, 2009, 162, 237, 77)
titanic <-c(3, 1997, 194, 200, 28)
star_wars <-c(4, 2015, 138, 245, 248)
infinity_war <-c(5, 2018, 149, 316, 258)
jurassic_world <-c(6, 2015, 124, 150, 209)
```

I can easily combine this vectors into a matrix using the function rbind(). The r in rbind() stands for row and this function allows us to combine multiple vectors and matrices by row.

```{r echo=TRUE}
film_matrix <-rbind(endgame, avatar, titanic, star_wars, infinity_war, jurassic_world)
film_matrix
```

## Naming Matrix Rows and Columns

I then learned that I could name the rows and columns in a matrix. I could use the functions **rownames()** to name rows and **colnames()** to name columns. First, I stored the names of the columns into a vector called **categories**. I then used the function colnames() to assign those names to the columns in my matrix.

```{r echo=TRUE}
categories <- c("rank", "year", "runtime_minutes", "budget_millions", "domestic_opening_millions")
colnames(film_matrix) <-categories
film_matrix
```

## Finding Matrix Dimensions
If I wanted to identify the dimensions (the number of rows and columns) in a matrix, I would use the **dim()** function. The output of this function gives me two numbers. The first number is the number of rows; the second number is the number of columns.

```{r echo=TRUE}
dim(film_matrix)
```

## Adding Columns to Matrices

Earlier in this post, I combined vectors into a matrix using rbind() and it allowed me to combine my vectors by row. The function, **cbind()** allows me to combine vectors and matrices by column.

Let’s say I wanted to add the domestic gross of the films as a column to this matrix. First, I would get the domestic gross of the films. Next, I would use cbind() to add the **domestic_gross_millions** column to the existing matrix.

```{r echo=TRUE}
domestic_gross_millions<-c(858, 761, 659, 937, 679, 652)
cbind(film_matrix, domestic_gross_millions)
```

I then stored the result in a new matrix called **entire_matrix**.

```{r echo=TRUE}
entire_matrix <- cbind(film_matrix, domestic_gross_millions)
entire_matrix
```

When adding a vector to a matrix, it’s important to make sure that the new vector is the same length as the number of rows and columns in the matrix.

## Indexing Matrices
Just as I indexed vectors, I learned that I could also index matrices. Since matrices are two-dimensional, they can be indexed in the following ways:    

- index to select specific values       
- index to select specific rows and columns

### Indexing By Element

Let’s say I wanted to extract the year that Avengers: Infinity War was released. I have to specify the location of this element by row and and column. In the screenshot below, you can see that Infinity War is in **row 5** and the year is in **column 2**.

![Highest Grossing Movies of All Time](two-highest_grossing_films-table.png)

```{r echo=TRUE}
entire_matrix[5,2]
```

I can also index matrices by row and column names instead of position:

```{r echo=TRUE}
entire_matrix["infinity_war", "year"]
```

I can specify the range of columns since the **budget_in_millions** and **domestic_gross_millions** columns are next to each other.

```{r echo=TRUE}
entire_matrix[5, 4:5]
```

I can also index columns are not next to each other. Let’s say I wanted index elements from the columns **rank** and **runtime_minutes**. Here I index these columns in two ways. The first example is by position, the second example is by name.

```{r echo=TRUE}
entire_matrix[c(3,5), c(1,3)]
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
entire_matrix[c("titanic", "infinity_war"), c("rank", "runtime_minutes")]
```

### Index By Row and Column

As mentioned, I can index to select a specific row or column. Let’s say I want to extract all the rankings for Avatar. All the rankings for Avatar are in row 2 of my matrix. I would indicate that I want to index all the elements of row 2 and leave the column position blank.

```{r echo=TRUE}
entire_matrix["avatar", ]
```

When I write an expression to index an entire row or column, I only need to specify the name of that row or column. The other position is left blank. In this next example, I index an entire column. Since row comes before column, I leave the row blank.

```{r echo=TRUE}
entire_matrix[ , "budget_millions"]
```

I could also index to select multiple rows and columns. If I want to extract the **year**, **runtime_minutes** and **budget_millions** columns, I would write:

```{r echo=TRUE}
entire_matrix[,c("year", "runtime_minutes", "budget_millions")]
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
entire_matrix[,c(2,3,4)]
```

If I want to extract the **star_wars**, **infinity_war** and **jurassic_world** rows, I would write:

```{r echo=TRUE}
entire_matrix[c("star_wars","infinity_war","jurassic_world"), ]
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
entire_matrix[c(4,5,6), ]
```

## Ranking Films

I can use the **rank()** function to specify the categories I want to rank the films by. This function returns a vector of numeric values.

```{r echo=TRUE}
rank(entire_matrix[,"domestic_opening_millions"])
```

## Calculating the Sum Of Values in A Vector and Matrix

This last section of this post is going to cover calculating the sum of values in a vector and a matrix.

I can calculate the sum of the values in a vector or matrix using the **sum()** function.

Let’s recall the original vector I created called **titanic**.

```{r echo=TRUE}
titanic <-c(3, 1997, 194, 200, 28)
```

I want to add these values in the vector. To do that, I would write this:

```{r echo=TRUE}
sum(titanic)
```

As you can see the sum of this vector is 2422. What if I wanted to calculate all the values of the **titanic** row of my matrix?

```{r echo=TRUE}
sum(entire_matrix["titanic", ])
```

Here the sum of value in my **titanic** row is 3081. Why are the two sums different? Remember that I added the **domestic_gross_millions** column to my matrix after the matrix was created. The original vector does not include the value for **domestic_gross_millions**.

Just as I did the sum of the values in a row, I can do the same for a column. If I want to add up all the values in **domestic_opening_millions** column, I would type the following:

```{r echo=TRUE}
sum(entire_matrix[, "domestic_opening_millions"])
```

So the sum of all the values in the **domestic_opening_millions** column is 1177. This means that combined opening weekend total for all the films is about $1,117,000,000!

This just about does it for matrices in R! For the next post, I’ll get into lists in R.
